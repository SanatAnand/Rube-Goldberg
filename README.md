# Rube-Goldberg
Rube-Goldberg Machine
This is part of our CS251 course project. We've made a Rube-Goldberg machine in C++ using Box2D physics engine. The simulation has components like- a water dam, a water turbine, an air-pump, a balloon, a glass of water, etc. We've made a simulation of a fire extinguisher.
